One of the most important responsibilities of a CTO is to choose a particular technology to be implemented in the company. In doing so, we must take into account a number of important points to ensure that we are implementing the best option for our organization. 

This time I want to tell you about 5 points that a CTO must consider when choosing technologies. It is worth mentioning that in order to comply with these points we must have a high knowledge of the business. Having said that, let's begin... 

## Point #1: economic viability

The first thing we should think about when we want to implement a certain technology in our company is its economic viability. This is not about whether we can afford the technology or not. It is a question of whether it contributes economic value to the organization, and whether this value is greater than the cost of the technology itself. 

At this point we must avoid the typical situation in which the CFO is asked if we can afford it or not, we must have as CTO knowledge of the financial status of our organization and based on that determine the feasibility of what we are implementing. Many times companies implement technologies that do not provide any value, simply because they can be paid for. It is our job to make sure that does not happen. 

A fairly simple way to know if a technology is economically viable is to ask ourselves a question: How much are we losing by not having that technology? 

## Point #2: product life over time 

People who work as CTOs have one thing in common; we love technology. But when the operation of a company depends on us, we have to leave aside the trendy technologies or the cool vendors of the moment. We must choose what lasts best over time. 

This includes of course programming languages, frameworks, libraries, cloud computing, mail services and so on. We must evaluate the stability of the company from which we are buying this technology, the number of companies they have as customers, in which sectors they work and of course if possible their economic situation. 

What I usually do in these cases is to choose technology from publicly traded companies, so I can check a little more thoroughly if the company is durable over time and therefore the support of the product I am implementing. 

In the case of open source technology, we have to look at who is behind it. Is it a person? Is it a company? Is it a group of people supported by a company? What other projects do they have? How long have they lasted or are they still supported? Among other things. 

## Item #3: cost of implementation 

Once we have decided that the product is economically viable and that we are not going to run out of support in the short or medium term, it is time to analyze the cost of implementation. The implementation cost has a lot to do with the success or failure of what we are doing. 

I know companies that have acquired software or other types of technologies and they are forgotten because implementing them became a headache. As CTO we must avoid this, because we do not want to have a company with bills to pay for something that is not even used. 

This is also directly connected to the following point... 

## Point #4: learning path 

After determining that the cost of implementing what we are doing is within the company's means, we have to analyze the learning path. It doesn't matter if this technology is intended for the company's engineering team, marketing, finance, customer service, or all of them. Every new technology we implement brings with it a learning path for whoever is going to use it. 

This path should be as short as possible and before acquiring the technology we should verify if the supplier provides the necessary resources or if we have to create them ourselves. If we have to create our own learning resources, this will inevitably increase the cost of implementation and the time the process will take. 

It never ceases to amaze me how many companies have technologies that no user knows how they work, or have applications installed on their work terminals that they do not even know what they are for. This only indicates the enormous failure of whoever manages the technology.  

## Point #5: complexity of maintenance 

Last but not least, there is the complexity of the maintenance of what we are implementing in our company. At this point we have to find out who is responsible for the maintenance: Is it our supplier? Is it us? Is it shared? Does it stop the company's operations when it is done? 

Of course, if the maintenance stops the operations of the company we have to calculate the losses that this can cause, if we have to do it we must also take into account if we have the knowledge to do it and let's not forget how much it is going to cost us every time it is required. 

If we are implementing software to be installed in the work terminals, we must also analyze how the maintenance or updates will be done. Will it be automated? Can it be done remotely? Do we have to send a technician to the work place or transport the equipment? 

I always try to choose the option in which the supplier is responsible for all this, this saves a lot of headaches to my companies and of course gives us time to focus on what really matters; take advantage of technology to be better. 

## Before leaving take this in consideration

Being CTO means that it is our responsibility to ensure that our company has the best technology on the market that is economically viable, that it gives us peace of mind over time, that it is implemented correctly, that users know and take advantage of what they have, that it is always in good condition and above all to ensure that with the technology we implement our company will be better than it was before.
