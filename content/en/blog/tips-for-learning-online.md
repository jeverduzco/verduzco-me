To deny that the Internet is the greatest school and source of information that humanity has created would be like denying today that the earth is a sphere. On the Internet we can learn **what we want, the day we want, and in the place we want.** The problem comes when we are presented with that vast amount of information, we don't know where to start, and we end up stressed out instead of excited as we should be. 

I started out in the self-educated world **14 years ago** as a teenager. Where I grew up the nearest school was several hours away by car and it was only an elementary school. This meant that I did not study in the traditional system and became 100% self-taught. 

After all these years of continuous self-study, I have some advice that I can give you if you want to **push your career and learn on your own.** You should know that it is not something simple and requires a lot of discipline and enthusiasm. But once you get the hang of it, you can be at the forefront in the areas that interest you. 

Open your favorite notebook, grab a notepad or just get your brain ready. Below, I will give you what I consider to be the best tips for being a ninja in self-learning. **Let's get started!**

## Assign a minimum and maximum amount of time to study in your day

Being self-taught requires a lot of discipline and self-control. This is because no one is forcing you to do it, as if you are being forced to go to a school. This may scare you a little bit, but it's pretty simple. Besides, if you love to learn it will not be a problem. 

**Don't set a fixed schedule** to study every day. Think about that time when the traditional education system forced you to study something when you didn't want to. Remember how boring that was? That's how you're going to feel if you set a fixed schedule for studying and try to stick to it. 

It's best to set a minimum and a maximum no matter what time of day you do it. It can be a minimum of half an hour and a maximum of three hours (this is my study time). Try to **keep to the minimum and not go over the maximum**, there are other things in life that need to be done, don't study all day. 

## It establishes a learning path of at least three months

Pivoting between fields of study when you are self-taught can be quite easy. One day you start studying something, it gets complicated and the next day you study something else. Doing this is a mistake, the best thing is to **create a learning path** on a topic for at least three months. 

This will allow you to experiment in that field and see if you really like it so that you can continue studying longer and specialize. If in the three months you haven't lost interest in what you are studying, then make a **longer study plan;** it could be a year or more. 

## Don't be afraid of the diversity of knowledge

One of the things that is most frustrating when you want to learn something new in a self-taught way is the **number of options that you face.** About this I can tell you not to be afraid of diversity. It doesn't matter if you program for a living, if you're interested in physics or chemistry, go for it! 

That's the beauty of the Internet and being self-taught. You can **learn as much and as many topics as you want** and as much as possible. You don't have to follow a study plan set by someone else. This also allows you to experiment with more areas of knowledge faster and find your passion or have it find you. 

## Practice what you have learned whenever you can

**Knowledge is useless if you don't create something great with it.** One trick I have is to learn for short periods of time (half an hour) and practice what you have learned immediately afterwards. This makes you not load your brain with too much new information and what you have learned goes into your long-term memory. 

Test your knowledge by creating **complete projects.** The most effective way I have found over these 14 years of continuous learning to memorize what I have learned over time is to do complete projects. For example, if you are studying about business; set up a business. 

## Debate, collaborate and share with everyone

One of the drawbacks of being self-taught is that you don't have classmates with whom you can discuss and share what you have learned in person. Fortunately, on the Internet you can find communities of all the topics you can imagine. **Discuss, collaborate and share!**

And most importantly... **Never stop learning!** We currently live in a world that changes faster than most people realize. Don't wait to learn something new once you need it, learn from before; prepare for the future.
