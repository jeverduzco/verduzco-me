This year many people suddenly found themselves in the situation of working remotely and communicating virtually but effectively. The problem is that not everyone knows the right tools to do so depending on their needs. Do you want to learn which tool best suits you? If the answer is yes, then you need to ask yourself the following question. 

## Do I need a single tool or as a complement? 

A unique application is one that only fulfills one very particular function, in this case: making video calls. A tool that acts as a complement is one that is part of a larger ecosystem of applications. 

**When to use a unique tool?** If your need is simply to make a video call or occasionally share a presentation, then what you need is a simple application with a unique purpose. 

There are many in the market that perfectly fulfill this task. The most notable are Zoom and Google Meet. 

If your needs go beyond simple video calling or screen sharing, then you need a more complete ecosystem. **That has an add-on to communicate integrated.**

An example of this is Microsoft Teams. This tool works as a complement to the entire Microsoft 365 suite. It is so versatile that you can integrate it with a CRM, physical phones, it allows you to work with files while you make the call, it has a whiteboard, you can take notes, record, transfer calls and a long etc. 

## Tips for choosing a single application or an add-on 

Under no circumstances should you commit the **error that the majority commits**. If all you need is to make video calls or virtual meetings, hire just that. Hiring a complete ecosystem to use just the video call plug-in is like buying a complete toolkit when all you need is a screwdriver. 

Conversely, if your needs require file handling, video calling, call transfer between the computer or integration with other applications, don't hire a single application! Hire a suite that has the **complement to communicate**. 

Finally, remember that communication management is an important part of making a remote computer productive. Having the right tool based on your needs makes all the difference.
