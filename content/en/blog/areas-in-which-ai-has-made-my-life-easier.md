**Artificial Intelligence** is here to stay, every day we see new products making use of it and yet society looks at it with **eyes of suspicion**.  A mistrust that is not justified, because Artificial Intelligence has not come to take our jobs, it has come to **help us with them** to make our lives easier. 

I consider myself a big fan of Artificial Intelligence, because every time I have the opportunity to try a new product that incorporates it: I do it. So today I come to tell you how Artificial Intelligence has made **my life easier in 5 areas**. 

## Graphic design and interactive design

I don't consider myself any good at graphic design, but it's something you need at least once a week. Artificial Intelligence in this field has made my life so much easier. I remember I used to spend many minutes cropping an image in **Photoshop** to remove the background and now with one click in **Canva I can do it thanks to AI.**  

Tools like **EveryPixel** also make finding elements for a design a very simple task and I can't end this section without mentioning **Let'sEnhance** and its ability to resize images for our designs.  

In the case of interactive design I love how Artificial Intelligence helps with tools like **Uizard** that turn a sketch into a fully interactive design. Or tools like **Bookmark** that with a few clicks allow you to create a website prototype in seconds thanks to the Artificial Intelligence they incorporate. 

## Photo and video editing 

I like photography, but not enough to dedicate myself to it, it's more like a hobby, because of that I can't afford to spend a lot of time editing a photo as if I made a living out of it. Artificial Intelligence in this case has come to save my life, because what used to take me half an hour to do with **Lightroom** now with tools like **Photolemur** or **Luminar AI** I do it in seconds. 

In the case of video editing, tools like **Premiere Rush** or **Unscreen** make the work of editing a video fun and fast. All thanks to the **Artificial Intelligence assists they have**. 

## Code writing 

Writing code is one of the things I like the most in life, because I love to create things with it. But it never hurts a little help from an Artificial Intelligence, in this case the **Visual Studio Code** extension called **Microsoft IntelliCode** works wonders, because when you are writing functions it suggests ways to do it based on Artificial Intelligence and what other users write. 

This extension saves a lot of time since it autocompletes functions and of course when you don't know how to do a function it can be of great help. It works with **Python and JavaScript**.

## Searches and investigations

Every day we do a lot of searches on the internet, Artificial Intelligence in this aspect has helped me a lot with different tasks. I remember when I had to go to currency conversion sites, time zone sites or Wikipedia to research something. Now I just ask **Cortana or Alexa** and I have the answer I am looking for in a second. 

Another tool that I use daily and that I am grateful that it exists is the **Microsoft Bing image search** mode, with this I can select an object within an image and search for other images that also have the same object, this Artificial Intelligence tool saves me a lot of time when looking for **similar images**. 

## Translations and conversations 

I cannot end this article without mentioning two tools that have served me well in both my personal and professional life. One of them is **DeepL**, the best online translator that exists and that is powered by Artificial Intelligence.  

The second tool I want to mention is **Skype** and its conversation translator, as it has helped me a lot to communicate with people mainly from the Asian continent. I am not going to leave without mentioning the real-time translation of **Microsoft Teams**, which thanks to its artificial intelligence I have been able to participate in meetings in languages I know little or nothing about. 

## Finally... 

Artificial Intelligence does not have to come in the form of **robots that want to kill us or machines that will take our jobs**, in fact, this does not exist yet... what does exist are **tools that with small functionalities powered with this technology make our day to day life more fun** and the activities we do in our life become easier to do.
