title: What it is, what it is not and why telemetry is necessary in applications for the DevOps process
description: Application telemetry is fundamental to the DevOps process. The problem is that it is confused with business analytics. Do you want to know what it is, what it is not and why it is important?

Surely you have heard that Windows 10 has a lot of telemetry that it sends in real time to Microsoft and that Android sends real time telemetry to Google. You probably also thought that the operating system is spying on you with such telemetry. But telemetry **has nothing to do with spying on you**, it has to do with the very operation of each system or application and is part of the DevOps cycle. 

## What is telemetry? 

According to Wikipedia it is: 

>Telemetry is a technology that allows the remote measurement of physical quantities and the subsequent sending of the information to the system operator.

But in simpler words and grounded to software development, we can say that telemetry: **is the measurement and analysis of the system by the development team.** 

Imagine that you manage a web application. You will want to know how many times a request to the API fails, the time it takes to resolve that request, etc. 

With telemetry **you can do it**. You can measure that and much more and then make decisions based on that data. You could say that telemetry is the analysis of the performance and operation of the system, but not of the user. 

## What is not telemetry? 

In the DevOps process, telemetry is considered to be the collection and analysis of data needed to keep the system operating. But **NOT the collection of data for other purposes.** For example, **Google Analytics is not considered a telemetry service** because it is intended for Google's advertising segmentation, to track the user and not for the development team to monitor the operation of the system. 

So... telemetry is not a feature that I spied on you because **it is NOT something that is used to monitoring you.** 

## Why is it important in the DevOps process? 

The answer to this is very simple: it is important because **what is not measured is not improved.**  

With telemetry you can **detect failures** in the API before users notice it, you can detect if the server is taking too long to respond, you can detect if in certain devices or browsers the application has a poor performance or detect the time of day when you should program the automatic scaling because that's when it's used the most. 

In short, telemetry is important because it is the only way that **the development team can be proactive** and correct what is wrong with your platform before the client reports it. 

Now that you know what it is, what it is not and what telemetry is for in the software development world. Don't be alarmed if Windows 10, Android or iOS incorporate it. It is absolutely **necessary** for the team to **detect failures** and work for you to enjoy that system or a certain application. 

What you should be worried about are the services that **collect information destined to monitor you** and not the service itself, from those systems **run** as if you were being chased by a horde of zombies. But **that's not telemetry**, that's directly analysis about you, not the system you use.
