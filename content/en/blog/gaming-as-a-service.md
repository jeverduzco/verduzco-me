With the recent introduction of the new generation of consoles by Sony and Microsoft, a war has broken out in social networks over which one will be the best. But the industry is not interested in that, today's is **Gaming as a Service.** 

While users on Twitter are fighting over which console is better, there is a strong trend in the industry away from them. This trend is mainly driven by two companies, **Microsoft with xCloud and Google with Stadia.** The first sees this technology as the way to go to keep the leadership in video games and the second sees it as the opportunity to be someone in an industry unknown to them. 

## The Cloud at the service of the Gamers 

In this new stage of the industry that gives life to **Twitch** it is not about who has the best console or the best PC, it is about who has the best cloud. And when we talk about clouds we have to talk about **Amazon, Microsoft and Google.** 

Curiously enough, all three companies are making inroads into the trend of Gaming as a Service, **Amazon does it with Luna, Microsoft with xCloud and Google with Stadia.** Each one in its own cloud, with its own technologies and its own plans, but their essence is the same; pay a subscription and play on any device. 

The problem will be for **companies that don't have a cloud** with enough capacity as is the case with **Sony**. The only way that seems to exist for them is to partner with one of the previous services. Outsourcing a cloud would mean they couldn't compete on price. 

## Compatibility: the key to success 

Part of the attraction of these services is that they will allow us to **play from anywhere** (with a good connection) and without the need to have a computer with an exorbitant power, likewise, the compatibility of equipment is what can be the trigger for success. 

Microsoft is supporting all Android 6.0 or higher devices that have 5GHz WIFI and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher. In addition, it has already announced that it will be compatible with **Samsung TVs**, that it will work on PCs with the Xbox app and that it will arrive at iOS as a Web App; so it is not ruled out that it can be played from the browser in the future either. 

Google and Amazon also try to support as many devices as possible, this only makes it clear that they don't care about the device, they care about the customer paying for a subscription. **This is where the console war loses all meaning.** 

## The business model that everyone wants 

The **subscription** model has proven its effectiveness in all industries that have implemented it. This is because it gives **more stability** to companies by having a more predictable income and makes available to users what they need at very low prices. 

Microsoft was the first company to take a massive risk with this model in the video game industry with **Game Pass**, a move that turned out to be magnificent and that has only grown since its birth. It could be said that the subscription model is the precursor of what is and will be the industry of **Gaming as a Service.** 

The detail is that in order for this business model to be profitable, an important requirement must be met: **having your own cloud.** And this complicates everything for those who are not Amazon, Microsoft or Google. But as everything takes time, we have to wait and see how it evolves. 

What can't be denied is that the trend has just begun and that the three giants of cloud computing are clear that **it doesn't matter what device you play on**, it matters that you play on their platform and of course paying a monthly fee.
