**Do you know the difference between proactive and reactive time?** That's why I'm here, to tell you what it is. 

Proactive time is the time you decide to use for something that interests you. On the other hand, reactive time is the time you spend on events that you do not control.

Unfortunately, reactive time is the one that consumes most hours of our day. And this is because we are very bad at managing our time and saying no. 

That's why **I'm going to give you an advice** that will reduce the minutes you spend in a reactive way, **turn off the notifications** of your cell phone and your computer, right now! 

Let me ask you a question **do you check your mobile because you want to or because you get a notification?** Think for a moment about the answer, then answer the following question **what percentage of notifications I receive are important?** 

Surely, you will realize that at **less than 50%** of notifications that make you waste a minute of your time are garbage. 

So follow my advice. **Turn off the fucking notifications!** It may seem silly, but it's from someone who has greatly increased his productivity simply by turning off the notifications and checking his cell phone when he wants not to when a notification arrives.
