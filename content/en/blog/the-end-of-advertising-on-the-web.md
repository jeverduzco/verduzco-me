Advertising on the web is something that has contributed considerably to create the **Internet we know today.** Thanks to it we have many free services that any user can use. But the reality is that we all hate advertising, and that is becoming more and more noticeable, so.... **Could it be that it is coming to an end?**

**I definitely think so...** although to delve deeper into the reasons why I think advertising on the web is in agony, you have to take a look at what we've come to. We are at a point of no return in which advertising has become very annoying, not only because it is advertising itself (nobody likes it), but **because it is segmented**, personalized to each user, it is everywhere and to achieve this people's digital data is abused.  

This has increased the distrust of users and they have chosen to promote a **series of trends** against it. Trends that have been supported by large corporations in the Internet industry. In the end, these trends become the reasons to think that what awaits (web) advertising is the grave. 

Let's analyze together the **three trends** (reasons) that I consider the main reasons to believe that web advertising is in a delicate state where death is the closest thing it has.  

## Trend #1: the war against user tracking

Current advertising on the Internet **lives from its segmentation and effectiveness in reaching users**, this is not achieved with magic, it is achieved by **analyzing every movement** that people make on the network or in applications, either with or without their consent. 

Fortunately, for us this is **starting to change** little by little, now we start to see browsers like **Safari, Microsoft Edge or Brave** blocking by default the **trackers** that websites use to segment users. We are also starting to see **operating systems** getting tough on tracking by telling the user what data the apps collect and offering the ability to say no. This will make it very difficult to segment users. 

This will make it very difficult to target advertising and therefore it will lose its effectiveness, advertisers will not pay for it and it all goes to hell. Some browsers like Google Chrome are reluctant to implement these measures, **but they will have to at some point**, or users will move to one that does. I don't know anyone who likes being tracked. 

## Trend #2: ad blockers win the battle

An easy way to get rid of advertising is with an **ad blocker**. This is also where browsers like **Brave or Opera** come into play, which by default incorporate an ad blocker, the rest of the browsers use **extensions.** 

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/454511/ad-blocking-cost-worldwide/) in 2015 the advertising industry was impacted by more than **$21 billion** thanks to ad blockers and by 2016 this figure had risen to **$41 billion.** Also in 2017 a [study](https://www.businessinsider.com/30-of-all-internet-users-will-ad-block-by-2018-2017-3?r=AU&IR=T) was published saying that by 2018 around **30% of internet users would use an ad blocker**, but it's been a long time coming and the trend has only grown. By 2019 according to [GlobalWebIndex](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/global-ad-blocking-behavior-2019-infographic/551716/) this figure in some regions reached **50% of internet users.** 

Of course companies that make their living from advertising on the web don't like this, **but there is nothing they can do**, the user who tries an ad-free website will never want to experience the ad-supported experience again. 

## Trend #3: the most visited websites remove advertising

The **last trend** I want to talk about today is that thanks to the two previous ones, many of the most visited websites and blogs in the world are starting to become paid or to change the advertising model. For example, the [webedia](https://www.webedia.es/) network of sites in Spanish has decided to **eliminate advertising** from their pages. They are not the only ones, we can see more and more sites that offer their content only by subscription. 

With **50% of the market lost** and the most popular sites turning their backs on it, advertising needs to reinvent itself, or else its days are numbered.

## What's next? 

The advertising model is changing, now we see for example that on YouTube is more common to see **sponsored content**, brands know that this can not block an extension, we can also see it in very popular websites like [Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/), where they have removed **Google advertising**, but publish **sponsored content.** 

This is better for all of us for two reasons: **it is done without tracking us**, that is, the sponsored content follows the theme that is normally published on the web so it is not segmented individually and it **is not intrusive** or annoying for the user, as it is published as if it were another article or as if it were part of the video. 

Before you go I want to invite you that if you are not in favor of advertising companies abusing your data to use one of the browsers that **block tracking** and of course install an **ad blocker**, the one you like, just do it.
