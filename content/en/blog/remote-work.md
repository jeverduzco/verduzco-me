If you're already here, it's probably because remote working has caused you frustration. Don't worry, you're not the only one who feels this way. 

This year brought some surprises that completely changed our lives. Remote working is one of them, because many people were not prepared. 

But not being prepared doesn't mean that we can't prepare ourselves, right? And you are a person who loves to prepare, so I'm going to share five tips that helped me to work remotely. Let's start... 

## Value work, not time. 

The most important thing at the time of having a team working remotely is not to value the time spent on a particular task but the result of it. 

Many employers are used to seeing their employees arrive at the office at a certain time and see them sitting at their workplace. This gives them a false sense of productivity, however, just because they are there does not mean they are productive. 

When working remotely, "bosses" cannot see whether their "employees" are working or not, so the best way to assess productivity is of course the work done. 

## Find a time when the schedules overlap.  

If you have a team working remotely it is more difficult to match, this is aggravated when team members are in different time zones. One solution to this problem is to find a time of day when everyone is online. 

In this way and at this specific time, the whole team can meet to discuss pending issues. 

## It avoids unnecessary virtual meetings and encourages asynchronous communication. 

It is very easy to fall into the temptation of scheduling virtual meetings too often, but this is not good for productivity. Use them for only very important things. 

The rest of the communication is done asynchronously, that is to say by email or chat teams where the response does not have to be instantaneous. If one of your team is focused on a job this will not distract them and they will respond when they are available. 

Real-time communication can be good in certain scenarios with high importance, but most of the time it only affects productivity. 

As additional advice in this section I can tell you to avoid mixing personal chat applications at work. I do not recommend at all to use for example WhatsApp, better use a service like **Microsoft Teams** or **Slack**, this allows your computer to separate your professional life from your personal life. 

## Give your team the right tools to work. 

For a remote computer to work properly everything must be available to everyone at any time. 

If someone on your team has to ask someone else for a document in order to do their job then you have a problem. A remote computer is not like in the office where you turn around and ask someone to pass you the Excel file on a USB stick. 

For the remote computer to work you must have the right technology, having real time file sharing is a must. 

## Trust your team and allow them to make decisions. 

If you don't trust your team and don't allow its members to make decisions autonomously, you are destined to have a broken remote computer. 

If someone has to wait a long time to be able to continue their work due to a huge chain of command and authorizations in the remote work world you are screwed. 

If you don't trust them change them, but let them make decisions that allow for a constant flow of work without creating bottlenecks from pending authorizations. 

## In short. 

A remote team reaches its maximum potential when it is valued for the work and not for the time, there is a suitable time of day when everyone is available to solve pending issues, you avoid exaggerated virtual meetings, you encourage asynchronous communication, you have the necessary technology, all members have the necessary information to work and you give them autonomy of decision so as not to create bottlenecks in authorizations.
