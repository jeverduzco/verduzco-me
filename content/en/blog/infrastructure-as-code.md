Designing and deploying cloud infrastructure often becomes a costly challenge. This is due to inconsistent errors between development and production environments or human errors in manual resource deployment.  

The **infrastructure as Code** evolved to solve the problem of discrepancies between different environments and to facilitate their deployment.  

This process automates the provisioning of infrastructure, allowing your company to develop, deploy and scale applications in the cloud with **greater speed, less risk and lower cost.** 

## What is infrastructure as Code? 

Infrastructure as Code is the process of **managing and provisioning resources in the cloud through Code files** rather than interactive configuration tools. 

Simply put, infrastructure as Code is the process of **replacing the manual effort** required to manage and provision resources with single lines of Code. 

Generally, the procedure of infrastructure as Code is as follows:

* Definition of infrastructure in lines of Code

* Managing the Code using Git 

* Automated deployment when processing changes 

This is an essential practice of **DevOps**, indispensable for a cycle of **continuous delivery of software** at a competitive pace. 

## Advantages of infrastructure as Code

### Cost reduction

By removing manual provisioning, the team can refocus its efforts on **other tasks.** 

### Speed 

The infrastructure as Code allows a continuous flow of software delivery more **fast and efficient**, thanks to the fact that the whole process is automated given the initial requirements. 

### Risk reduction  

Automation eliminates the risk associated with **human errors.** This decreases downtime and increases system reliability. 

### More agile tests

Infrastructure as Code allows **DevOps** teams to test applications in **production-identical environments** from the beginning of the development cycle. 

### Stable and scalable environments

Infrastructure as Code provides stable environments quickly and to scale by avoiding manual configuration in **every deployment.** In addition, it reinforces consistency by representing the desired state of resources through Code.  

Code-like infrastructure implementations are repeatable and avoid deployment problems caused by configuration drift or lack of dependencies.  

### Change tracking

You can **version the configuration files** like any source Code file, you have a complete track of the changes that each configuration suffered and you can return the infrastructure to previous versions. 

### Configuration consistency 

Infrastructure as Code **standardizes completely** the configuration of the infrastructure so that there is less chance of errors or deviations.  

This will reduce the chances of any problems of **incompatibility with your infrastructure** and help your applications run more smoothly. 

### Better security 

If all computer, storage and networking services are **defined in lines of Code**, then they are deployed in the same way each time.  

This means that security standards can be defined consistently across the entire infrastructure and will **always** be met. 

## One tip

It doesn't matter if you are a freelance developer or part of a larger development team. Infrastructure as Code is necessary in workflows and can **avoid you a lot of problems, delays and money loss.**
