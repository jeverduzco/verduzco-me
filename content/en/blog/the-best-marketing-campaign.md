Memes are a **fundamental part of our internet**, they are made from real people, from fiction and of course from products. However, few companies react either **positively or negatively** when a meme is made of one of their products. In this case, the move has been perfect for them. 

In a world where marketing competes for attention in short periods of time and where going viral is one of the objectives, creating effective campaigns is **increasingly complicated.** But there are times when the genius within us wakes up and not only a little attention is achieved: **you become a trend.**

## One product and many memes. 

In January of this year (2020) the first real photos of what would be **the new generation of Xbox were leaked.** As it usually happens with almost all products, some loved the console, some hated it and others just made memes. **Many memes!**

As we can see in the previous image **the product was the victim of a series of mockeries** thanks to its design so similar to a **refrigerator.** This is not at all strange, really. But what follows is for me **the best marketing move of the year.** 

## Turning a meme into reality. 

For the people who had made all those memes **the novelty had already passed.** For the market as well; since **there were no longer any product trends** and the sector's media were talking about something else. 

But suddenly... when I went on Twitter it turned out that I found **Xbox as a trend** and people seemed to have lost their heads over the product, but... why? It turns out that someone had to **turn the meme into reality.** Here it is!

## A genius from which we can learn. 

Getting people to talk about a product in a world where attention is increasingly difficult **is not an easy task** and even less so when time has passed since its launch. But if you know how the Internet works and you dare to **do new things**, you can do it. 

What they have done with Xbox is a clear example, **you take advantage of people's mockery** to get all the media in the technology sector and social networks to give you publicity that is worth gold with something as simple as turning a meme into reality. 

So I suggest that when you launch a product and people meme about it, **don't bother.** Find out how to make the most of the attention people are giving you and **mock your product with them.**
