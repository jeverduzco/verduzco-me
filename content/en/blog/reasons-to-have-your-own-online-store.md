E-commerce is one of the industries that has experienced the most growth in these pandemic times and there are two main ways of doing it. The first one is selling on established platforms such as **Amazon** and the second one is having your own store. **Which one is more convenient?** 

There is no simple answer to the above question, however, today I want to talk about **five reasons to have your own online store.** Even if you also sell on platforms such as Amazon.  

## Reason #1: you don't risk losing everything. 

Platforms like **Amazon or Mercado Libre** can become an important source of your online sales revenue. But if you only base your business on them, **you risk losing everything** with a closure of your account; it can be by mistake, by changes in policies or for many other reasons. 

That's why having your own store is so important, so if you lose an additional sales channel such as an external platform, **you won't be left with zero.** 

## Reason #2: you design your own customer experience.

When your customers shop on an established platform, they live the **experience that platform gives them.** When they shop at your own online store, you can **design a personalized experience** that best suits your customer's profile. 

This could be a better flow in the checkout process, more payment options or **better customer service.** It all depends on how innovative your store is. 

## Reason #3: you build a stronger brand 

Selling on third-party platforms does **not help your brand.** Because unless you sell a unique product, your brand presence will be reduced to a **username.** On the other hand, with your own online store you can make your brand **memorable and long-lasting.** 

And if you complement your online store with a **good social media presence**, you can make your store the first choice of many people. 

## Reason #4: you can create custom integrations 

Having your own online store gives you a lot of versatility, this can be used to **integrate with other systems** you use such as a point of sale, if you have **physical establishments.** 

Practically the options are unlimited, you can have the store fully integrated with the company's internal software and automate things like **invoicing** among many other flows. 

## Reason #5: you have your own metrics. 

The big e-commerce platforms analyze even the smallest movement of buyers, but they do **not share that data with you.** With your own online store you can implement your **own analytics systems** and get to know your customer much better. 

You can take advantage of this to improve the experience you offer, **improve your products**, improve your marketing and many other things. Remember that data is very valuable and can be very useful when growing your e-commerce business. 

## Before you leave

Consider that e-commerce is one of the industries that is experiencing and will experience the **most growth in the next decade.** I invite you if you have a business to take this very seriously and start **offering your products online.** And if you need any help you can always contact me through my social networks ðŸ˜Š
