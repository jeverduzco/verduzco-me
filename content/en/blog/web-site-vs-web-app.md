The web development ecosystem is so complex and broad that it causes much confusion among less technological users. Many people have sought me out to **quote a website**, but what they really need **is a web application**. Do you know the differences?  

For end users, understanding the differences between a website and a web application is not that important, but if you run a company, it is. Their differences affect the functionalities, the development time and the cost of the project. 

Let's look at the most important things that make the difference between a site and a web application. 

## Users and data 

Most websites do not allow you to create a user account and do not store data, they are limited to **showing public content** and not personalized. 

On the other hand, most web applications have user management and store **specific information about each user.** 

## Interactivity 

The interactivity of a website is usually limited to **navigating the site**, filling out some contact form and in some cases putting in comments. 

In the case of web applications, the user's interactivity with them can be **as complex as the developer has wanted it**, there are applications that allow hundreds of interactions. An example of a highly interactive application is **Excel online**.

## Functionality 

In the case of a website there is only one functionality that is always fulfilled: **showing information to your visitors**. 

For a web application there is no limit or type of specific functionality. **We have web applications for everything**: design software like Canva, text tools like Word, email systems like Outlook or video call applications like Teams.  

## Integration 

Most websites have a **zero integration**, meaning that they do not coexist with other systems or platforms. This is because their basic functionality is only to show information to their visitors. In some cases this information can be dynamic, but there are very few of them. 

Unlike websites, applications **cannot exist without integration**. Almost all of them are integrated with billing systems to charge their customers, are integrated with databases, with authentication systems and a long etc. 

## Other differences 

Web applications can also be **installed on computers or mobiles**, which websites do not do. A web application can **run in the background** like a native Windows or Android application would and a website cannot. 

## And of course...  

A web application **is much more expensive** than a simple website. That's why I recommend that you think about what you need before you go around quoting projects, because you might ask for a website and they will sell you a web application. 

It is important that you analyze **the needs of your company**, if you need to have user accounts, save and process information, a lot of interactivity, advanced functions and integrations: **then you need a web application; not a site.**
