We cannot deny that we have a crisis that is leaving many people with few options, one of these options is undoubtedly to undertake by Internet; **either selling products or services**. The problem is that you don't always have the money for the infrastructure (hosting, SSL certificates, etc.). Fortunately the cloud can save the day, read on and learn how.

Let me make it clear that if you want to set up a WordPress or something similar, these services won't work for you. They are designed for static websites (simple HTML) or much more modern web applications, such as **Nuxt.js, Next.js.** 

Since you know what type of application or site you can deploy in these services, let's give it a try and talk about the three that **I consider the best**. With them you can start without paying anything, but without changing a single setting you can get to give service to thousands of customers. 

## Netlify: the easiest to start.

One of the ecosystems for modern applications that has the best user experience is undoubtedly [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Among the different functions that the service has is that of **static hosting.** In it you can host your website for free and add extra features such as forms, authentication or logic with Serverless technology. 

I recommend it if you want to deploy a basic website such as a **landing page or a portfolio.** I don't recommend it if you want to put an online store or something more complex that over time will receive many users. The reason is that in your free plan many features are limited and you have to escalate to a fixed monthly payment. 

## Firebase Hosting: the ideal for moderately complex applications 

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is one of the favorite services for developers starting out. It has a database, static hosting, user authentication, serverless functions among other things. With the static hosting you can easily deploy your site or application **for free and scale it as needed.** 

An advantage that Firebase has over Netlify is that you can create **more complex applications** without much effort. This service, if I recommend it for online stores, you can create really great things without spending a single dollar.

## Azure Static Web App: the hosting for those who do not know the limits 

If you are a natural pro, then you should choose [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/). Although it is a bit more complex to configure **it integrates with all Microsoft Azure services.** This means that you can start for free and integrate functions based on any other service available in **Azure**. 

You can add logic in a very simple way using the technology of **Azure Functions** in your site or application. So without a doubt for applications and sites that want to evolve as the business evolves this service is the best.
